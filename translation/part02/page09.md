## **How to continue learning React**

You were just introduced to three essential React concepts: **components**, **props**, and **state**. Having a strong foundation in these will help you get started building React applications. Once you feel more confident, also check out these other React topics:

° [How React handles renders](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/render-and-commit) and [how to use refs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)

° [How to manage state](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/managing-state)

° [How to use context for deeply nested data](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

° [How to use React API hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference) such as `useEffect()`

## **React Resources**

Over the years, many courses, videos, and articles have been created to help developers learn React. While it’s hard to recommend resources that will fit your learning style, one invaluable reference is the [React Documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) which contains interactive sandboxes to help you practice the topics.

When it comes to learning React, **the best way to learn is to build**. You can gradually adopt React by using `<script>` and what you've learned so far to add small components to an existing website. However, many developers have found the user and developer experience React enables valuable enough to dive right in and write their whole frontend project in React.

## **From React to Next.js**

While React excels at building UI, it does take some work to independently build that UI into a fully functioning scalable application. The good news is that Next.js handles much of the setup and configuration and has additional features to help you build React applications.

Next, we'll migrate the example from React to Next.js, discuss how Next.js works, and introduce some web development concepts to help you learn more advanced Next.js features.
